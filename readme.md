# Responsive Flexbox Navigation

This is a responsive flexbox top bar navigation menu that collapses to a hamburger navicon on smaller screens. I tried to use pure CSS solutions as far as possible.

Flexbox is pretty awesome when it comes to building responsive sites. It's also the easy solution to horizontally and vertically center anything. 

Of course, in IE support is still iffy... But that's the common woe for all front-end developers so be sure to provide a fallback (which I didn't here).

Colours inspired by Wes Anderson (of course :D). Feel free to fork, comment etc. Peace.
